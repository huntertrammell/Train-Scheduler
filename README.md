# Train-Scheduler
An app that uses firebase to read and write data and uses moment.js to manipulate and ouput time.

Working Demo: https://huntertrammell.github.io/Train-Scheduler/

Users can enter the train information on the page, and after submit it will write to the database and convert to the current time based on the interval selected by the user. Then ALL submissions will be pulled from the database and convereted into the table above.

Fairly simple, but demonstrates my ability to read and write data from Firebase as well as use moment.js to handle time conversion
